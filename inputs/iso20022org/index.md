**Welcome to my website!**

My name is Pawe³ Ryll.![Home](https://www.iso20022payments.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Home-300x300.jpg)

I am a Payments Business Analyst with over 15 years of experience.

I decided to run this website as over the years I have become passionate about payments.

Especially now, I think that the payment industry is more attractive than ever before.

One of the main factors is ISO 20022 – a new standard that has gained momentum.

If you would like to contact me, you can do it via my LinkedIn account.

**What is ISO 20022?**

In short, it is a methodology to develop standard messages for all financial areas.

You can learn about ISO 20022 in ISO 20022 for dummies.

You can also visit the ISO 20022 official website www.iso20022.org.

However, visiting the ISO 20022 website is only the starting point.   
There are many ways ISO 20022-compliant messages are implemented in the market.

The way ISO 20022 is used in cross-border payments, high-value payments systems, or retail payment systems varies a lot.

The purpose of this website is not to provide a comprehensive course about payments or to explain the basics.

It’s more about analysis of the payment messages/schemes/systems which are based on the ISO 20022 standard. I assume that the reader has some basic knowledge about payments. Having said that, I am committed to making things as simple as possible, so they are understandable to a wide audience.

As a basis for my analysis, I use publicly available documents and information.

Needless to say, the information provided on this website reflects only my personal opinion based on the analyzed documents.

If the content of this website helps anyone to become more familiar with the topic of payments, I would be more than happy.
